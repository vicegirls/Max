Max
===

Max is an audio converter and CD ripper for OS X that aims to provide significant flexibility while encoding/transcoding with the best possible quality. 

When extracting audio from compact discs, Max offers the maximum in flexibility to ensure the true sound of your CD is faithfully extracted. For pristine discs, Max offers a high-speed ripper with no error correction. For damaged discs, Max can either use its built-in comparison ripper (for drives that cache audio) or the error-correcting power of [cdparanoia](http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/).

Max can generate and convert audio in over 20 compressed and uncompressed formats including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Apple Lossless, Monkey's Audio, WavPack, Speex, AIFF, and WAV. For many popular formats the artist and album metadata is transferred seamlessly between the old and new files. Max can even split a single audio file into multiple tracks using a cue sheet.

*Max leverages open source components and the resources of OS X to provide extremely high-quality output. For example, MP3 encoding is accomplished with [LAME](http://lame.sourceforge.net/), Ogg Vorbis encoding with [aoTuV](http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/aotuv/), FLAC encoding with [libFLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/), and AAC and [Apple Lossless](http://alac.macosforge.org/) encoding with [Core Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/Introduction/Introduction.html). Many PCM conversions are also possible using Core Audio and [libsndfile](https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile).*

Other features include: 

 - MusicBrainz integration
 - Automatically add to iTunes library
 - Set the number of GPU threads to be used for encoding
 - Error correction
